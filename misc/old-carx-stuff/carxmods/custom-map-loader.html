                This plugin allows you to load a custom map from an OBJ format 3D model and use it as a track in the game. To make collisions work correctly you need to have a single mesh OBJ for
                collisions. This plugin also doesn't touch the original track's collision model so you can just go back to the original track without even leaving the lobby. <br /><br />Development
                has been put on hold. Planned features were going to inclue a menu where you select which map to load and the ability to disable and enable maps ingame. <br /><br />Big thanks to
                Huskyy and Mr.CoolGoat for help during development
