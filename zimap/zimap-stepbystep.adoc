=== Adding the textures for UI

The map loader needs 4 textures for every custom map.

icon.png:: This is what is shown in the singleplayer track selection screen
loadscreen.png:: The loading screen background image
lobby.png:: The image that is shown when making a new multiplayer lobby
minimap.png:: Minimap image shown in the singleplayer track selection screen

Add these textures into your mod map folder.

NOTE: Keep texture sizes reasonable (a 1920x1080 icon doesn't make sense)

=== Ready to build

.The final folder structure for building a zimap file
image:images/image8.png[image]

Make sure you are not missing any files or else the build process will fail.

=== Building the map using Zimap SDK

To build the map you just have to drag the whole map data folder onto the MapBuilder.exe icon and that will start the build process. If the process is succesful you should have a ``.zimap`` file in your map data folder.
