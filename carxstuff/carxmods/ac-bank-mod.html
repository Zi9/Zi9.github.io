                This plugin allows you to use soundbanks from the game Assetto Corsa and replace the default ingame
                sounds with the ones from the soundbank. It uses the FMOD sound engine.<br /><br />Sadly it has been
                broken due to CarX implementing FMOD themselves and that breaks my implementation. Additionally it was
                going to have a menu where you can select which soundbank to load and automatic loading of the bank you
                select on race start.<br /><br />Currently development of this plugin has been put on hold but there is
                a chance i will revisit it sometime in the future.
